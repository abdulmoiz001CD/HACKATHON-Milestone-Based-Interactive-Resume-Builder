# HACKATHON-Milestone-Based-Interactive-Resume-Builder
This project is designed to help you create, customize, and manage resumes using various interactive features. Below is an overview of the different components of this project.

Sections
Static
The Static section includes a basic resume builder that allows you to create a resume using a static template. This part of the project focuses on providing a simple, uneditable template for quick resume creation. You can view and use the static template to generate resumes without any interactive features.

Dynamic
The Dynamic section introduces interactive elements to the resume builder. Here, you can modify certain sections of the resume dynamically. This component uses JavaScript and TypeScript to update the resume content in real-time based on user input. The dynamic features allow users to see immediate changes as they edit their resume.

Edit
The Edit section provides advanced functionality to make the resume editable. Users can click on different sections of the resume to make changes directly on the page. The changes are reflected immediately without requiring a page reload. This section leverages TypeScript for robust editing features and ensures a smooth user experience.

ResumeDownloadAndShare
The ResumeDownloadAndShare section enables users to download and share their resumes. Once the resume is created or edited, users can download it in various formats or share it directly via email or social media. This component integrates download functionality and sharing options to facilitate easy distribution of resumes.
